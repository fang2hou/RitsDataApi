**This is a personal open source project. Please use `nobo` at your own risk.**

**nobo** is a spider that you could get your data from each service provides by Ritsumeikan Univ.  
You can use **nobo** to build your own data API with many frameworks(`Flask`, `Django` etc.).

# NOTICE:
Ritsumeikan University deployed f5 obfuscator several months ago. :(  
Although, I don't know the situation in other schools. The truth is legacy version cannot work perfectly nowadays.  
But if you wanna build your own spider with legacy version, please check the `legacy` branch.

The mainly difference between `legacy` version and `master` version:  
1. `legacy` use `requests` to send requests, but `master` use webdriver for Chrome.
2. `legacy` is faster, but it cannot handle the page with code confusion.

## Fix list:
- [x] [manaba] course list @ 7/28/2018
- [x] [manaba] better performance @ 1/28/2019
- [ ] [syllabus] ritsumei syllabus -> manaba syllabus
- [ ] [syllabus] get syllabus by id

## New feature:
- [ ] [syllabus] search syllabus by string
- [ ] [compusweb] scholarship information

    pip3 install nobo
    ```
3. Install latest version of Chrome and ChromeDriver
   - [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), latest version is recommended
   - [ChromeDriver](http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads), unzip and move `chromedriver`/`chromedriver.exe` into your project directory.
4. Use **nobo** in your project (.py).

    ```python
    import nobo
    # if you wanna output in an easy way
    import nobo.io
    ```

# Manaba Spider
It seems that Manaba of each school are different, you can change a little bit code inside [manaba.py](manaba.py) to let nobo be compatible with your manaba page.

## How to use
1. Create a `RitsStudent` instance.

    ```python
    fangzhou = nobo.RitsStudent("is0000ab", "12345678")
    ```

2. Use `get_course_list()` method to get all courses information.  
`get_course_list()` will login automatically. After parsing, it will return a list that contains all information of courses.  
Use `try...except...finally...` to handle exceptions is highly recommanded.

    ```python
    try:
        course_list = fangzhou.get_course_list()
        nobo.io.export_as_json("temp.json", course_list)
    finally:
        exit()
    ```

## Course list example
The example course will show as following.

```json

    {
        "basic": [
